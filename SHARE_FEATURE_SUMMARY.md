# üéâ Share Feature Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

### 1. Share Utilities (`src/lib/shareUtils.ts`)
A comprehensive sharing library with functions for:
- **Instagram Story sharing**: Opens Instagram with pre-filled message
- **Twitter/X sharing**: Opens Twitter with victory tweet
- **Generic Web Share API**: Uses native device sharing (mobile)
- **Copy to clipboard**: Fallback for all platforms

### 2. About/Landing Page (`src/components/About/AboutPage.tsx`)
A beautiful, public landing page featuring:
- Animated hero section with trophy icon
- 6 feature cards explaining how the game works
- Gradient background with floating animations
- "Get Started" buttons to join the app
- Fully responsive design
- **No authentication required** - perfect for sharing!

### 3. Enhanced Winner Screen (`src/components/Tournament/WinnerScreen.tsx`)
Updated with:
- "Share Victory" button that opens a modal
- Multiple sharing options in one place
- Visual feedback (success messages, copied states)
- Instagram-branded button (purple/pink gradient)
- Twitter/X-branded button (black)
- Copy link button with confirmation
- Generic share button (mobile only)

### 4. Routing Support
- Added React Router to the app
- `/about` route is public (no auth required)
- All other routes remain protected
- Proper URL handling for Vercel deployment

### 5. Environment Configuration
- Added `VITE_APP_URL` environment variable
